# JavaScript mini IDE

A mobile app for editing and running JavaScript code. The code parser is implemented in C++ and communicates to Java through the JNI. It finds the text positions of the highlights to be made, while the Java code decorates the text with text spans at the right spots. The code editor view is a subclass of EditText, but with the virtual keyboard disabled, since I made a completely custom one from scratch to better incorporate special symbols. V8, a JavaScript engine from Google, is used the run scripts. Some functions like printing or sleeping are predefined and execute Java code when called from JavaScript. To store user scripts, I implemented a file manager, saving the user's work on disk. The UI includes a list of available files and examples. The whole project consists of ~40 Java classes and C++ files, ~2800 lines of code.
